# Adopted Coding Rules

Part of the coding and testing guidelines is adapted from two MIT-licensed rule sets. The binding text is in [../CODING-GUIDELINES.md](../CODING-GUIDELINES.md) (the TypeScript `TS`, Node scripts `R`, security `SEC` and design `D` rules) and [../TESTING-GUIDELINES.md](../TESTING-GUIDELINES.md) (`T21` to `T26`). This folder records where they came from and carries the one file vendored verbatim.

## What was left out

The agent-rules React, Tailwind, shadcn, Next.js, NestJS, Prisma, Drizzle, accessibility, performance and git files are not adopted: the library's component rules are the rest of the coding guidelines and its specs (`specs/`). The library ships no server, so the server parts of the Node.js and security sets (request handling, signals, cookies, sessions, CSRF, rate limits, response headers) are left out; what remains applies to `scripts/` and to markup the components render. Rules that conflict with an existing library rule were rewritten to the library rule.

## Updating

To take a newer upstream version, compare the upstream file at its new commit with the adapted rules, carry over changes that still fit, and update the commit column above. Replace the vendored mini file only with an unchanged upstream copy, and keep its two-line header naming the source, the new commit and the license.
