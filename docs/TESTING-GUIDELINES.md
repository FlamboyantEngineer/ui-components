# Testing Guidelines

Every unit test in `src/`, `labs/src/` and `test/` and every browser test in `e2e/` follows these rules, on top of the [coding guidelines](CODING-GUIDELINES.md). Tests verify the specs: they read the page as a reader does and act as a reader does, and they name the requirement they check. Rules marked **(enforced)** fail `npm run check`; the others are checked in review.

## Files and names

**T1. TypeScript next to the source.** A unit test is `<module>.test.ts`, or `.test.tsx` when it renders, beside the module it tests (`table-row.tsx` → `table-row.test.tsx`). `test/` holds repository-wide tests (package manifest, lint rules, the spec checker) and shared fixtures (`test/*-fixtures.tsx`, `test/hooks.ts`). Browser tests are `e2e/<component>.spec.ts`. **(enforced: Vitest only collects `*.test.ts(x)`; `check:structure` requires `<name>.test.tsx` for each component)**

**T2. Test names start with the requirement IDs they verify**, then say what the reader sees: `it('UIC-TABLE-2.1 sorts by a column header press', …)`. A test may name several IDs; an ID may be split over several tests. `check:specs` fails when no test listed under a requirement's `Verification:` names its ID. **(enforced)**

**T3. Check hooks against the spec.** The test that first renders a component's parts calls `expectHooksMatchSpec(container, 'SPEC-NAME', { slots, callerAttributes })` from `test/hooks.ts`. It fails on any `ui-*` class, `data-*` attribute or `--ui-*` property the spec does not declare, and on a required slot that did not render. Pass `document.body` for parts that render in a portal (popovers, menus, dialogs), and list the `data-*` attributes the test passed itself in `callerAttributes`.

## Queries

**T4. Query through `screen` by role, label or text**, narrowed with `within(element)`: `screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })`, `within(row).getByRole('checkbox')`. A role and name query also checks that the element is exposed to assistive technology.

**T5. Hooks are public API, so tests may read them.** `container.querySelector('.ui-table__row')`, `closest('.ui-field')` and `toHaveAttribute('data-dirty', 'true')` check the styling contract (`specs/HOOK-CONTRACT.md`). That is why `testing-library/no-node-access` and `testing-library/no-container` are off. Do not reach into markup that is not a hook or an ARIA relationship.

**T6. No test ids.** Query by role, label, text or a documented hook, never `getByTestId`. A `data-testid` may appear only as a caller attribute the test checks is forwarded. **(enforced: lint)**

**T7. Keep queries cheap in large widgets.** A role query computes the role, name and visibility of every candidate in its scope, which is slow in a table or tree with hundreds of elements (a query can take longer than the press it precedes). Scope with `within` to the row or panel, keep a reference instead of querying the same element again (elements survive re-renders), find menu items inside the menu that `findByRole('menu')` returned, and use `getByLabelText` for a control named by `aria-label` when a role query is the slow part.

## Interaction

**T8. Act through `userEvent`.** Start each test that interacts with `const user = userEvent.setup()` and await every call (`await user.click(…)`, `await user.keyboard('{ArrowDown}')`). user-event sends the pointer, focus and keyboard sequence a browser would, which React Aria's press and focus handling relies on.

**T9. `fireEvent` only for what user-event cannot produce:** scroll, wheel, load, error, drag and drop (`dragStart` to `dragEnd`), `pointerCancel`, `lostPointerCapture`, composition events and the key events an input method sends while it composes (`isComposing`, key code 229). Lint rejects every `fireEvent` call; each allowed one carries an `eslint-disable-next-line testing-library/prefer-user-event` comment, or a disable and re-enable pair around a block, that says which of these it simulates. No file disables the rule as a whole. An input-method test presses its keys through `pressComposingKeys` (`test/composition.ts`) unless it checks a sequence that helper does not send. **(enforced: `testing-library/prefer-user-event`; the reason on each disable is checked in review)**

**T10. Fake timers go through user-event.** `test/setup.ts` lets Testing Library advance Vitest's fake clock (it settles each call on a zero timeout through a global `jest`), so plain `vi.useFakeTimers()` works and a test can check delays to the millisecond; use `{ shouldAdvanceTime: true }` only when real time passing does no harm. Set up the user with `userEvent.setup({ advanceTimers: vi.advanceTimersByTime })`, advance time inside `act(() => vi.advanceTimersByTime(ms))`, and restore real timers in `afterEach(() => vi.useRealTimers())`. Without `advanceTimers`, user-event's own delays wait on frozen timers and the test hangs.

**T11. Wait for what React Aria defers.** Overlays open after the press, focus moves into them and back to the trigger in a later frame, and some focus moves follow a re-render. Use `await screen.findByRole('menu')`, `await waitFor(() => expect(trigger).toHaveFocus())` or `findBy` queries for those, and plain `getBy` queries for everything that is synchronous. Never sleep for a fixed time.

## Speed and isolation

**T12. Tests are parallel-safe and order-independent.** Each test renders its own tree and builds its own fixtures; `test/setup.ts` unmounts after every test, and the Vitest config restores mocks and stubbed globals. Restore anything else a test changes (`vi.useRealTimers()`, prototype stubs, listeners on `window` or `document`), write temporary files under `mkdtemp`, and never depend on another test's state. Vitest isolates each test file's DOM realm and module graph (`isolate: true`), including inlined React Aria modules, so native observers, queued overlay callbacks, storage and module state cannot reach another file's document. Clearing document attributes or resetting modules in a reused DOM realm cannot provide that guarantee. Restore a window function a test replaces by writing the original value back; restoring its property descriptor leaves the fake in place. Wait with `waitFor` for focus that a component moves after a frame, such as focus returning from a closed overlay, rather than asserting it right after the key press. The suite must pass with any `--maxWorkers`.

**T13. Keep each test under the 5 second default on a loaded machine.** Split a long test into focused ones that start from the state they need (pass a `defaultValue` that already holds the earlier steps) rather than chaining every step in one test, and remove waits that are not needed. Raise a timeout only for a flow that is inherently long, with a comment saying why (for example, the `Table` suite's full React Aria grids).

**T14. Run in jsdom unless the test needs Node only.** A test that reads files or spawns scripts starts with `// @vitest-environment node`. jsdom has no Web Animations; `test/setup.ts` stubs `getAnimations`.

## Lint rules that are off

The Testing Library and jest-dom plugins lint every test. These rules are off on purpose:

| Rule                                | Why                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `testing-library/no-node-access`    | Hooks are public API (T5).                                                                                                            |
| `testing-library/no-container`      | Same reason: tests read hook classes through the container.                                                                           |
| `jest-dom/prefer-to-have-style`     | Functional inline styles and `--ui-*` properties are hooks checked as written; `toHaveStyle` compares jsdom's computed style instead. |
| `jest-dom/prefer-to-have-value`     | `aria-valuenow` is checked as the attribute string; `toHaveValue` reads range roles as numbers.                                       |
| `testing-library/no-manual-cleanup` | Disabled in `test/setup.ts` only: Vitest runs without globals, so Testing Library cannot register its own cleanup.                    |

## Browser tests

**T15. Open labs through the `lab` fixture** from `e2e/fixtures.ts`: `await lab.open('<name>')` waits until the lab has rendered and its stylesheet has loaded, `await lab.expectAccessible(selector)` runs axe on that part of the page, and any page or console error fails the test. Locate cases by their state matrix cell (`[data-lab-cell="state=pending size=md"]`) or demo (`[data-lab-demo="…"]`), then by role.

**T16. Retry values that settle with `toPass`.** Scroll positions, measured sizes and anything that follows animation frames are checked inside `await expect(async () => { … }).toPass()` rather than read once.

**T17. Control time with `page.clock`.** Call `page.clock.install()` before `lab.open`, and pause the clock (`pauseAt`) only once overlays have opened, since popovers need running timers to appear.

**T18. Run axe on settled overlays.** Wait until an overlay has no `data-entering` or `data-exiting` attribute before `lab.expectAccessible`: mid-transition opacity produces false contrast violations.

**T19. Mind the sticky lab toolbar.** The lab chrome is a sticky bar at the top of the page; a target scrolled to the top edge sits under it and the click lands on the toolbar. Bring targets into view with `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` and let scrolling settle (two animation frames) before pointer actions, or drive the control from the keyboard.

**T20. Retry combobox typing from an empty input.** On a loaded runner the first keys can land before the list opens. Clear the input, focus it and type inside one `toPass` block, so a retry starts over rather than appending.

## Assertions

Adapted from the agent-rules testing set ([coding-rules/README.md](coding-rules/README.md)).

**T21. Assert what a caller or reader can observe:** rendered roles, names and hooks, and the calls a callback prop receives. Do not assert private function names, call counts or internal call order unless the spec requires them.

**T22. Mock at a module or network boundary,** never the module under test.

**T23. A snapshot is never the only assertion** for logic or markup.

**T24. Build test data with a small factory or a shared fixture** (`test/*-fixtures.tsx`) instead of copying a large fixture between files.

**T25. Cover the failure paths a change introduces or touches:** invalid, empty, disabled, read-only and error states, where they exist.

**T26. Never weaken an assertion or skip a test to make it pass.** Fix the code, or change the spec requirement and its test together.

## Testing helpers

Hosts test their screens with the helpers in `@flamboyantengineer/ui-components/testing` ([specs/TESTING.md](../specs/TESTING.md)). The library's own tests may use them too; a helper that a host would need belongs there rather than in a test fixture.
